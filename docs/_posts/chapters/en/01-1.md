# God Creates Everything

```
Genesis 1:1-2:3
```

## 1. Devotion Objective

- Children who will understand that God created everything
- Children who will thank God for all that He has done

## 2. Note to Parent

The Bible is divided into 66 books. Genesis is the very first book in the Bible. The Bible, eternal and unchanging, is a true history -- it is God's story of what really happened.

- The word "genesis" means "beginnings" or "origins."
- All things had a beginning. Nothing/no one (except God) existed before the beginning.
- "Created" means "to make out of nothing." Only God can do this. Only God is all powerful. Nothing is too hard for God.

## 3. Opening Prayer
Dear God, Thank You that we can read and study Your word, the Bible. Thank You that we can learn about You and all the things You have created. Help us as we study Your word. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

## 4. Memory Verses

Psalm 33:8-9
> 8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!
> 9 For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.

## 6. Story Background
The Bible is God's Word to us about who He is and how we are to live for Him. The beginning of the Bible tells us how He created everything; that God spoke and He created all things. He did all of this in six days and on the seventh day He rested.

- Get a piece of rope that is 15 feet long and tie the ends together.
- You, your child, and other family members (the more the merrier) will get in a circle with each one holding on to the rope.

- When you say "STOP," the person closest to the knot has to say the next part of the story.
- Continue doing this till the story is told.
