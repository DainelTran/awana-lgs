- For children to see that with God nothing is impossible; He is the Almighty GOD doing everything in His own way, and in His own time.
- For children to know that GOD is a God of justice, He hates sin and wickedness, and He will surely execute judgement to unrepentant people.
- For children to learn that obedience is the proof that we; believe and trust in GOD. And GOD is pleased when we do: as He says.

- In today's Bible Story, we will no longer read about Moses as at this point Moses had died (Deuteronomy 34). Moses has faithfully followed the Lord. He served the Is- raelites with humility and with reverence to the Lord. In verse 9 of Deuteronomy 34, you will read of the next leader the Lord has chosen to lead the Israelites to the Promise Land.
- Jericho and its walls have been standing for thousands of years even before Joshua. The walls have been fortified: or strengthened. They stand 25 feet high and 20 feet thick. Jericho was a symbol of military power and strength the Canaanites (the people occupying the Promise Land) considered it invincible. Yet truly God displayed His power and might being far beyond human capacity and comprehension when He gave instructions to Joshua. God did not: give a battle tactic, instead He gave specific instructions that meant that the battle is His and under His control.
- During the 13 days of going around Jericho, the Israelites may have not seen any effect of their labor to the walls yet they continue trusting in GOD. We will learn here: the lesson on waiting upon the LORD.

As Joshua is approaching Jericho, he meets the commander of the Lord's army. Joshua falls on his face to worship him and is instructed to take off his sandals because he is standing on Holy Ground. Then, he gives Joshua the instructions about how he will be able to conquer this large city with huge walls around it.

Read Joshua 6:1-16 and 20. Do the same actions as before. This time, add in the sound of the blowing of the horns. Let kids make loud noises each time they circle the city of Jericho, and then the last time, they add in the shout of "Hallelujah!"
