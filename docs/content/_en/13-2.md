- For children to learn that God is faithful to carry out His: plans and to fulfill His promises.
- For children to understand that we all need to trust and obey God, regardless of what others are doing. For children to see that if we have put our trust in Christ Jesus as Saviour, we are Abraham's descendants, based on the promise of GOD

1. The Name Almighty "GOD" is adapted from the Hebrew word "ELOHIM," which comes from a smaller word, "EL" that suggests "the great, mighty, absolute, intense power of GOD." It is by this great name, Almighty GOD, to which GOD made great and mighty promises to Abraham because nothing is too hard for GOD.
2. From last week's lesson, it is important to note and explain to your child that because people scattered, nations were formed. We are now going to learn about the life of Abram and how God worked in his life. (You may trace Abraham's family line in Genesis 11)
3. God changed Abram's name (and even Sarai's) because he would become the father of many descendants: Abram means "exalted father"; Abraham means "father of a multitude (many) of children."

From our past Bible stories, what did you learn about God?

God has chosen Abraham to make a great nation from him and a son that He will give him. God promises him that he will have more children than the stars in the sky. God makes a great promise to Abraham that He will never break.
