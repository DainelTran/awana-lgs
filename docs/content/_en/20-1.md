## 1. Devotion Objective
- For children to learn that bitterness or hatred towards may lead us into doing horrible things, such as hurting them or causing them pain - For children to realize that GOD will protect those who are His -who are called according to His purpose - For the children to see that no one cannot stop GOD from accomplishing HIS plan; that in all of what hap- pened, God designed it all for good, for His purpose

## 2. Note to Parent
1. In sitting down to eat bread the brothers of Joseph displayed their heartlessness to what they have done to him; there is no sign of guilt, no fear of GOD. Their hatred has covered their senses. Jealousy that is unchecked leads to serious sins as what is seen with the brothers of Joseph.
2. The Medianites or Ishmaelites were descendants of Abraham who were traders.

## 3. Opening prayer:
 Our Great God and Father, We praise You for Your Word which allows us to learn today. Help us to understand and learn about the consequences of hating our brothers. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

James 1:2-3b - Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. James 1:3b

## 8. Story Retell
 COUNT-ACT-AND TELL
1. Assign numbers to each part of the story; show a simple, uncomplicated, easy to remember and modify, action that generally tells what happened in that part. Example: In verse 18, "saw him from afar" would be placing hands over brows while standing and gazing; and "to kill him" would be as if holding a knife and doing a stabbing action; One should say the number first, then do the action while saying the words, as, "ONE. they saw him from afar, and planned to kill him. TWO." Do this for the 10 verses
2. lt would be great if you would sample this by using this very thing in telling the story. Remember you should

## 10. Closing Prayer
 Dear God, We give You thanks for making us think and realize so many things about ourselves - how we see and respond to people around. Forgive us for being envious of others. Teach us to be content and joyful with what You are giving each of us. Teach us to be joyful that we have You as our GOD and Father. In Jesus name we pray, Amen
