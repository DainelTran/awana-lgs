## 1. Devotion Objective
- For the Children to know that God wants us to trust Him: with the important things in our lives
- For the Children to understand that God wants us to accomplish things according to His ways
- For the Children to learn how to worship the Lord with gladness

## 2. Note to Parent
* In the book of 1 Samuel, David's struggles as he waited to be Israel's next king can be seen. He was a man of faith, waiting for God's perfect time for him to be king. He respected King Saul despite him trying to kill David in several occasions.
* Background to the ark and the mercy seat (Exodus 25:10- 22)
- God told Moses to make a wooden box covered with gold called the ark of the covenant. It was to be put inside the most holy place where God was to live.
- Moses was to make a lid of pure gold called the mercy seat and place it on top of the ark of the covenant.
- They told Moses to place the two tablets of stone, with the Ten Commandments written on them, inside the ark the covenant, under the mercy seat.
* The first attempt failed (2 Samuel 6:1-12)
- They transported the ark on a new cart. But God had specifically commanded that the ark be carried by Levites; (Number 4:15; 7:8-9; Deut. 31:9), using poles placed through rings on the sides of the ark (Ex. 25:14-15;) (2 Samuel 6:3-4)
- David's method is the same that has been used by the world, like the Philistines. Though he was doing the right thing, he was doing it in the wrong way (1 Samuel 6:7-15)
- God struck Uzzah down for touching the ark. Touching the ark was a direct violation of God's law (Num. 4:15) - (2: Samuel 6:6-7).
- David became angry because of the Lord's outbreak. And because of Uzzah's death David was scared, so he left the ark in in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for 3 months and God blessed him. (2 Samuel 6:8-12).
* The second attempt was successful (2 Samuel 6:13-15)
- This time the ark is carried properly (2 Samuel 6:13; Chronicles 15:12-15).
- David celebrated before the LORD. Joy was a vital part of both worship and celebration (2 Samuel 6:14)
