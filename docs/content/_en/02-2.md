## 1. Devotion Objective
- Children will understand that God created us in His image - Children will appreciate and be thankful for the life that the Lord gave them
## 2. Note to Parent
God had lovingly, carefully, perfectly created everything in preparation for His final creation: man! Isaiah 45:18 says that God made the earth to be inhabited, that is, lived in! All man would ever need was waiting and ready.
* The creation of Adam (Genesis 1:27, 2:7)
- Only God could put life into Adam
* Adam was the first and only man God created from the ground (Genesis 2:7)

## 3. Opening Prayer
Dear God, Thank You for another week that we can read and study Your word, the Bible. Thank You for creating everything. Help us as we study the Bible. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

## 4. Memory Verse:
Genesis 1:27-27So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created Him; male and female He created them. Verse explanation:
- We know it is not talking about our bodies. God doesn't have a body of flesh and bones like we do.
- Instead, God was referring to the part which cannot be seen. The Bible calls this part of us which cannot be seen our soul and our spirit. Man's body was created to be the "house" of this unseen part, the soul and the spirit.
- God planned that the unseen part of man would have a mind, emotions, and a will, created in the image of God.
