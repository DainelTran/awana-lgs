## 1. Devotion Objective
- For children to learn that Satan is a deceiver.
- For children to see that Satan is God's enemy and their enemy as well.
- For children to see the importance of knowing and understanding God's Word.

## 2. Note to Parent
1. Satan knew about God's warning to Adam concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; this is shown how he falsely repeated this to Eve.
2. Satan hates God, and wants to destroy the man and woman God created therefore he planned to deceive Eve.
3. Satan used a serpent to do his plan - at this time he came to Eve in this snake-form sice, unlike today, the animals had not been harmful in any way to Adam and Eve or to each other, so Eve was not afraid.
4. Satan still deceives and destroys people. He does not use a serpent like he did with Eve but uses whatever way people will accept.

## 3. Opening Prayer
Our great God and Father, Thank you for you rWord that cautions us against our enemy, Satan. Continu eto strengthen us, and make us love your promises and commandments with all our hearts. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

## 4. Memory Verse:
- Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
- Wages - payment
- Death - separation from God forever
- Eternal - goes on forever and ever
