## 1. Devotion Objective
- For children to understand God's claim on their lives because He owns everyone and everything.
- For children to see that they cannot save themselves, but God saves those who trust Him.
- For children to know that that they can come to God by faith.

## 2. Note to Parent
1. Abraham and Sarah were too old to have children: Abraham was 100 years old, and Sarah was 90; Sarah never had a child. She herself knew it was impossible at her age to bear one. That is why in Genesis 18:1 she laughed when God said she would have a child.
2. God is the Almighty GOD - He can do whatever HE wants to do; NOTHING is impossible with HIM.
3. Years have passed since HE promised Abraham a son, but GOD fulfilled HIS Promise! That is who GOD is. God does not change His Mind. HE gave Sarah a son just as HE told Abraham HE would. Abraham and Sarah called their son Isaac.

## 3. Opening Prayer
Our Faithful God, How amazing and awesome You are, indeed! We are joyful today to again read and study Your Word and talk about Your Greatness! Guide us as we study. Lead us to obey and worship You more! In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

## 4. Memory Verse:
Psalm 33:4-5 For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness. He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the Lord. (ESV)

## 6. Story Background
In previous weeks we have talked about Abraham receiving a promise that he would be the father of a great nation though he did not have any children. He got impatient and had a son with Hagar. But God is faithful and does not forget His promises. Three men visited with Abraham when he was 99 and told him that in one year they would return and Sarah would have a son.
