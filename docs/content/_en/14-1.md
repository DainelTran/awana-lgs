1. Abraham and Sarah were too old to have children: Abraham was 100 years old, and Sarah was 90; Sarah never had a child. She herself knew it was impossible at her age to bear one. That is why in Genesis 18:1 she laughed when God said she would have a child.
2. God is the Almighty GOD - He can do whatever HE wants to do; NOTHING is impossible with HIM.
3. Years have passed since HE promised Abraham a son, but GOD fulfilled HIS Promise! That is who GOD is. God does not change His Mind. HE gave Sarah a son just as HE told Abraham HE would. Abraham and Sarah called their son Isaac.

In previous weeks we have talked about Abraham receiving a promise that he would be the father of a great nation though he did not have any children. He got impatient and had a son with Hagar. But God is faithful and does not forget His promises. Three men visited with Abraham when he was 99 and told him that in one year they would return and Sarah would have a son.
