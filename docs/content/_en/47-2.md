- Aram was the country northeast of Israel. This place is now modern-day Syria.
- Naaman was commander of the king's army in Aram. He was a brave and victorious Aramean commander who led various victories for his country. The king of the Arameans was pleased with Naaman's military victories and referred to him as his servant (2 Kings 5:6), a term used for high officers in the army. Because of this status, he was probably a wealthy man.
- Naaman owned servants and a young girl from Israel was a servant to his wife. This little girl had been taken away from her parents in a raid and brought to this foreign country of Aram.
- Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases, during Bible times there was no cure. People with leprosy were highly contagious and had to be quarantined outside of the cities.
- When the prophet Elisha sent Naaman to wash in the Jordan River seven times, Naaman was furious with the instructions perhaps this is because the Jordan river was a small and dirty river. As a person with position, he might have expected other solutions and not be humiliated. But when he humbled himself and obeyed, he was healed by God. This reminds us that when obeying God humility is required. We must trust that His ways are better and for our good.

Comic Å trip - Give each child a sheet of paper. Have them fold it in half, then fold that half again and then a third time. When you open the paper, there should be 8 boxes on the paper. For each scene or action in the Bible story, have each child draw a simple picture or object in each box in the order that it happens in the story. Let your child/children retell the story to by using their comic strips.
