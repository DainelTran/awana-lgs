- For children to learn that God knows the future of man
- For children to learn that envy, anger, and hatred goes along together and will lead to even more hatred.
- For children to see that envy and hatred is not of GOD. This tendency to be envious and be full of hatred is a result of the sinful nature we all have inherited from Adam.

 1. From our last lesson we read about Jacob as a young man. In today's Bible story, Jacob is now older and has 12 sons. His favorite is Joseph, this made his brother jealous: and angry at him.
2. Each of us is born separated from GOD, sinners, with a heart that is selfish, envious, hateful, and other evil things. This is our nature which we inherited from our father, Adam
3. God knew exactly what was going to happen to Joseph's: family. Joseph could not see his future. He didn't know how his dreams would be fulfilled. It was GOD who placed those dreams in his mind. Only GOD can see the future.
