## 1. Devotion Objective
- For children to know that God always provides a way of escape for those who believe and trust in Him .
- For children to understand that God had truly done what He had promised , as He rescued the Israelites from Egypt .
- For children to understand how the story of the Pass over Lamb foreshadows the gospel story of Jesus' death for us on the cross

## 2. Note to Parent
- God told Moses that He was going to bring one more plague, the most horrible of them all, on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, God promised Moses that Pharaoh would let them all leave.
- The Israelites were sinners , and they too deserved to die for their sins. But God had mercy on them. God ex plained very carefully to the Israelites what they could do to escape this awful thing that was going to happen to the Egyptians .
- Each family was to find a year old , male lamb - perfect one with no sickness or defect. They were to kill it at twi light, and take some of its blood and put it on the two doorposts of their homes , so the firstborn animal and child will be saved and not have to die . The blood remind ed them that the punishment for sin is death ! This blood on the do was going to save their firstborns from God's judgment . The lamb had to die . The blood had to pour out .
- This experience of the Israelites is now known as the Passover because those who obeyed God's instructions were passed over and the firstborns in that household did; not die . Not only is this a reminder for the nation of Israel , but it is also a reminder to us God's amazing plans . The blood of the spotless lamb reminds us of what Jesus had done on the cross . Jesus was the perfect lamb who died for our sins ! God wants each of us to receive Jesus as ourt Savior , and when we do . He has a plan for your life only He can fulfill just like the Israelites.
