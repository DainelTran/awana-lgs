## 1. Devotion Objective
- Children will see that man's ideas of how to please God & be acceptable to Him, are not God's ways. His ways, recorded in His Word (the Bible), are the only acceptable ones to Him.

## 2. Note to Parent
 -Although Adam & Eve have disobeyed God & have been sent out of the garden of Eden, Adam & Eve are enabled by God to have two sons - Cain & Abel.
- Cain & Abel were born sinners, because their father, Adam, was a sinner separated or cut off from God.
- Not only was Adam the father of Cain & Abel, but he was also the father of all peoples in the world. Therefore, all people in this world are born sinners, cut-off from God.
- God planned a way so people could come to Him because He loved them. They would have to come to God in the way that God told them to come, by faith.
- God has not changed. He is still the same today. He does; not command us now to sacrifice animals, but He is still the Only One who can make a way for us to come to Him. We must come God's way, otherwise, He will reject us as He rejected Cain.

## 3. Opening Prayer
Dear God Thank you for loving us by showing Your plan on how we can come to You. Help us not to do things our own way but to come to You for help in the right way In Jesus' name. Amen

## 4. Memory Verse:
Proverbs 14:12 "There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death." Proverbs 14:12 A way of life may seem right to some people. But because it leads to death (separation from God) it is the way of sin & foolishness.

## 5. Story Opening
Have you ever been so angry? What happened when you got angry?
## 6. Story Background
Both Cain and Abel brought offerings to God, but Cain brought an offering that HE thought was good, and Abel brought the offering that God told them to bring. God ac- cepted Abel's offering, who came to God by faith in the way that God required and rejected Cain's offering who tried to approach God in his own way. Cain was very angry & refused to listen to God.
