## 1. Devotion Objective
- For children to understand God's claim on their lives because He owns everyone and everything.
- For children to see that they cannot save themselves, but God saves those who trust Him.
- For children to know that that they can come to God by faith.

## 2. Note to Parent
1. Abraham and Sarah were too old to have children: Abraham was 100 years old, and Sarah was 90; Sarah never had a child. She herself knew it was impossible at her age to bear one. That is why in Genesis 18:1 she laughed when God said she would have a child.
2. God is the Almighty GOD - He can do whatever HE wants to do; NOTHING is impossible with HIM.
3. Years have passed since HE promised Abraham a son, but GOD fulfilled HIS Promise! That is who GOD is. God does not change His Mind. HE gave Sarah a son just as HE told Abraham HE would. Abraham and Sarah called their son Isaac.

## 3. Opening Prayer
Our Almighty God, Thank You that You hear us and know us. Guide us and teach us through our Bible story today. We praise You for we can trust in You always. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.
