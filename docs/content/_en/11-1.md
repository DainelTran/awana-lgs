## 2. Note to Parent
*God remembered Noah and all those inside the ark - Genesis 8:1-4, 14-17.
- God safely kept Noah and his family and the animals in the ark. God didn't forget Noah and the others in the ark. He said He would save them, and He did. He does what He: says. God never changes; He never forgets. God said He would destroy all outside the ark, and He did.
* God gave His commands and promises to Noah Genesis 9:1-2.
- God gave Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, control over the animals, birds, and fish just as He had given it to Adam in the beginning. The world and everything in it belongs to God. But He gave it to man to take care of for Him. God gave the rainbow as His sign Genesis 9:12-15.
- The rainbow was given as God's sign to show that He would never again destroy the earth by a flood. When you see a rainbow, remember that God gave the rainbow as a sign that He will never again destroy the world by a flood.
- Many thousands of years have passed since the flood. God has kept His Word.
