## 1. Devotion Objective
- For children to learn that true wisdom comes from God
- For children to understand the importance of asking God for wisdom

## 2. Note to Parent
- Israel became a great nation under the kingship of David. He had been king of Israel for forty years (7 years in Hebron & 33 years in Jerusalem (1 Kings 2:10-12). After King David died, Solomon, the son of King David and Bathsheba, became king. Solomon was a young man when he took over the kingdom.
- Early in his reign Solomon went to Gibeon (a high place where the ancient tabernacle & the bronze altar was - 2 Chronicles 1:3-6) to offer a great sacrifice to the Lord. These high places had been originally used by idol worshipers. Even though the law of Moses demanded that the: Israelites not use pagan altars for worshipping God, it appears that this was a common practice in Solomon's time. God had not yet chosen a permanent & exclusive place of worship (1 Kings 3:2).
- I Kings 4:29-30 & 34; 10:23-24 relate what King Solomon: was known for throughout his own country and other nations. He is thought of as the wisest man who ever lived. Solomon was to be the richest & most honored king of his: day. His life may have been shortened, and yet he lived to rule for forty years (I Kings 11:42). In his time, the kingdom: of Israel was richer and more powerful than it had been at any time before or has been since.
- Yet for all his wisdom, Solomon walked away from God and lived a life full of sin. He used his riches and wisdom for his own glory. He loved & married many foreign women who worshiped idols and persuaded Solomon to worship idols also (1 Kings 11:4)
- There is another King who is wisest of all kings, His name is Jesus. He is sinless, the perfect great King, who is always faithful & always knows what is best for us. The source of true wisdom & of gaining wisdom is knowing Him.
