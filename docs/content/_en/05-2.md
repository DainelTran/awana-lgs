## 1. Devotion Objective
- For children to learn that Satan is a deceiver.
- For children to see that Satan is God's enemy and their enemy as well.
- For children to see the importance of knowing and un- derstanding God's Word.

## 2. Note to Parent
1. Satan knew about God's warning to Adam concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; this is shown by how he falsely repeated this to Eve.
2. Satan hates God, and wants to destroy the man and woman he created therefore he planned to deceive Eve.
3. Satan used a serpent to do his plan - at this time he came to Eve in this snake-form since, unlike today, the animals had not been harmful in any way to Adam and Eve or to each other, so Eve was not afraid.
4. Satan still deceives and destroys people. He does not use a serpent like he did with Eve but uses whatever ways people will accept.

## 3. Opening Prayer
Our Great God and Father, Thank you for the opportunity to get back to your Word and learn. Thank you that we can be warned about Satan's deception, and be reminded to study and embrace your word. Give us the grace to respond to what you are teaching us. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

## 4. Memory Verse:
- Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord
- Romans 6:23 Wages - payment; Death - separation from God forever, Eternal goes on forever and ever.
